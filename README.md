# Phishing Awareness Training

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship.

The objective of this task is to create awareness about phishing attacks and
educate users on how to identify and avoid them.

The presentation covers:
- What phishing is
- Different types of phishing attacks
- How to identify phishing emails and fake websites
- Social engineering techniques used by attackers
- Best practices to stay safe online

This task helped me understand the importance of user awareness in cybersecurity.
